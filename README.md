am_esPIC_1D
A 1D Electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Code in MATLAB



Overview
am_esPIC_1D is a 1D electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code implemented in MATLAB. It is developed as part of the Particle-in-Cell code development project for MSc students at the Nuclear and Plasma Physics Laboratory, Central University of Punjab.

This code simulates the dynamics of charged particles in an electrostatic plasma system, solving the Vlasov-Poisson system using a Spectral method for field updates and a Leapfrog scheme for particle motion.
